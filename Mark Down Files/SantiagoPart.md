# SANTIAGO

## Neutral Ending

### Scenario 1

Walking out the door, you rush to the car. Nearly late for the concert, you must hurry on your way.
You are now in the car, leaving your driveway.

#### Options

- Take a shortcut
- Take normal route

<!--Path A-->
### Take Shortcut (Leads to good ending)

Having taken the shortcut onto your way to work you realized not only will you make it on time, but you even have some time to get gas before checking in for work.

#### Options

- Continue to the concert
- Get some gas

#### Continue to the concert (Neutral)

You made it pretty early to the concert. You found your spot and sat down. With nothing to do you wait for the concert to start.

#### Get some gas (Good)

You went to the gas station and fill up your tank. Realizing you don't have any snacks for the concert, you go inside the gas station's convience store. Grabbing some tasty snacks for event you went to the cashier to pay out. The cashier asks you if you were interested in buying any cigarettes, vapes, or lottery tickets.

You think to yourself you were pretty lucky in having so much spare time that maybe you should try your luck in a lottery.

Minutes later you find yourself scratching a lottery ticket in your car. You won! It isn't much, but a prize of $900 is great nonetheless!

<!--Path B-->
### Take Normal route

You made a poor decision. Going to the concert fairgrounds via your normal route is too slow and time consuming.
You can't be late to miss this once in a liftime chance.

#### Options

- Find an alternative route
- Speed is KEY. Speed is KING!

#### Find an alternative Route (End: Neutral)

You decided to stop panicking and be calm. You turned around and began looking for an alternative route that would take you to your destination without causing you to be any more late.
With some success, you found a new route. You made it before the concert started. Now you can sit back and relax.

#### Speed is KEY. Speed is KING!

One bad decision deserves another. You, on top of choosing the slower route, decided to speed in traffic. Well, thankfully, no one got hurt by your reckless driving, but now you are on the side of a road with a police officer asking you what were you thinking. Guess you won't be seeing your favorite band after all.
