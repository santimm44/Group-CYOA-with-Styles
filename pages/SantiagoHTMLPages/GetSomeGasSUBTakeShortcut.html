                    You went to the gas station and fill up your tank. 
                    Realizing you don't have any snacks for the concert, you go inside the gas station's convience store. 
                    Grabbing some tasty snacks for event you went to the cashier to pay out. 
                    The cashier asks you if you were interested in buying any cigarettes, vapes, or lottery tickets.
                    <br>You think to yourself you were pretty lucky in having so much spare time that maybe you should try your luck in a lottery.
                    <br>Minutes later you find yourself scratching a lottery ticket in your car. You won! 
                    <br>It isn't much, but a prize of $900 is great nonetheless!
